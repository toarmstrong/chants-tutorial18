# Generic

## Generic validation:

* Is everything edited also linked to an image and surface?
* Is every image and surface cited linked to edited “text”?
* Are the citations properly formed?
* Does the edition comply with TEI?
* Does the edition comply with project-specific encoding rules?
* Does everything cited follow paleographic rules?
* Does everything cited follow orthographic rules?

## Generic verification:

* Has everything on the surface been cited?
* Has everything edited been edited accurately?
* Is everything edited correctly indexed to the proper imageROI and surface citation?
* Does each cited region completely and accurately cover the relevant section?

Are the paleographic rules properly formed? Are the orthographic rules properly formed?  

# Chant

## Chant-specific validation:

* Is every neume citation indexed to a text citation?
* Can the neumes be properly aligned to the text?  That is: for each aligned section of neumes and text, one of the following in the neumes _must_ equal the total number of Latin syllables: total number of pitches, total number of neumes, total number of neume syllables.
* Are the neumes properly formed according to the Virgapes rules?
* Are neume syllables properly formed according to the Virgapes rules?
* Does the imageROI for the text match the imageROI for the aligned neumes?
* Does every subsection belong to a feast, and does every feast belong to a chant?

## Chant-specific verification:

* Is every neume correctly cited?
* Is every neume/neume syllable correctly aligned to the text?

Are the rules of neumes correctly defined?  Are the rules of parallel alignment correctly defined?  Does the validation account for variations in alignment (i.e.: neumatic vs syllabic vs melismatic sections)?
