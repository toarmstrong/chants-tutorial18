# Melodic patterns

What melodic patterns are present in:
* individual chants
* chant genres
* one manuscript
* comparable manuscripts

What patterns are visible in repeated neume sequences?  Which patterns appear if the neume itself is broken down to lows/highs/neutrals?  

Are there patterns that seem to be tied to certain genres or parts of a genre or chant?  Does a certain phrase only ever occur at the beginning of a gradual, for example?

# Relationship of melodic patterns to textual content

* Do specific words have repeated melodies?
* Do specific melodic phrases have repeated melodies across different genres?
* What is the relationship of melodic patterns and text compared between manuscripts?  

# Musical texture

* How can we compute musical texture? Is it more accurate to consider:
  * number of neumes : number of syllables
  * frequency of neumes (are there more 4-note neumes in a section?)
  * number of pitches : number of syllables

With a computed musical texture, we could:
* consider the textures most common for each genre of chant
* compare overall texture between manuscripts (for the whole manuscript, a feast, or a chant)
* compare texture of chants or feasts
* examine the changes in texture between chants, between feasts, or within a chant
