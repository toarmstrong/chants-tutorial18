# Purpose

Creating images of each neume character makes verification of edited neumes more efficient.  While "Virgapes" was developed to be accessible to humans, images of neumes provides a more efficient point for comparision with a cited image.

# Method

Created black and white transparent PNG images of each neume character (according to Virgapes) based on standard neume charts and the appearance of neumes in Einsiedeln 121.  Used photoshop's illustration tools.

# Use

For verification of neume melodies -- each glyph refers to a single Virgapes unit (i.e., 1.2.0.1) and will be displayed for that unit in verification.
