## Revisiting Semester Goals

### Learning Goals

1. Gain a better understanding of the meaning and value of a multitext edition through academic research and practical application, especially as it applies to chant.
   1. Success; [discussion](https://toarmstrong.github.io/chants-tutorial18/analysis.html) of plans for analysis of chant and proposal to CANE demonstrate modes of analysis only available with a digital edition.  I have also better learned the difference between the edited document and the published edition.  The edited document includes choices in corrections and abbreviations; but the edition by nature must show evidence of choice: only one option may remain.
2. Learn from a broad range of digital humanities (particularly musicological) projects to understand the nuance of our own
   1. Success; learning about CTS and cite2 URNS, an introduction to scala and tut, the standard architecture of an MID project, and image support (& pyramidal images) for the digital edition contribute to a better understanding of the existing background and DH history of the chant project.
3. Create a comprehensive review of digital humanities projects working on St. Gall notation beginning with materials developed for ICMS and DH2018
   1. Success & more; see “[Concepts in Other Projects](https://toarmstrong.github.io/chants-tutorial18/more.html)” -- discusses other existing project missions and takes this further by examining other projects’ conceptual frameworks and compared them to the chant project.
4. Understand the history of editions from manuscript to facsimile to digital
   1. Did not cover this
5. Codify XML tags for chants project
   1. Success; see “[Chants Vocab](https://toarmstrong.github.io/chants-tutorial18/chants-vocab.html)”


### Practical goals for the Chant project

1. Improve the workflow for editing chant – what is the most accurate and efficient method for recording neumes?
    1. Somewhat successful; added to the existing (paper) neume chart and used the neume picker -- but the most successful way to learn to edit neumes seems to be to practice.  
2. Develop validation system to check entered data automatically
    1. Successful! We implemented validation this semester, and have begun troubleshooting the particular issues with parallel documents.  One editing standard we developed around this was to cite the same imageROI for text and neumes-- so it should only appear once during validation. 
3. Determine best practices for teaching/learning neumes, which will make it easier for new and returning students to enter data
    1. Success! Created the [Chant Editors’ Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/HCMID/chant/wiki/Chant-Editor's-Quick-Start-Guide), which is a useful addition to in-person training sessions for new members.  So far, the chant group has used it to great success for editing and validation.
4. Create or conceive new tools (like the neume-picker) that will make this process more efficient and accurate
    1. Somewhat successful; we have begun adding visual verification of neumes with the [neume glyphs](https://toarmstrong.github.io/chants-tutorial18/glyphs.html) and will continue this next semester
5. Add to our edition – complete Christmas Day and at least five more feast days for Einsiedeln 121 (by the semester’s end), with comparisons in SG359
    1. Done! We have a total of 6 feasts edited for text in both manuscripts, three for neumes in SG359 and 1 ½ for neumes in EINS121.  See the [Status Update](https://github.com/HCMID/chant/wiki/Editing-Status-Report).
6. Determine which feasts in particular will provide the most provocative comparisons, and complete those (semester & beyond)
    1. Not done; but as we edit text and neumes completely for both, already interesting comparisons have arisen.  In Christmas Day (h011), Einsiedeln 121 often expands chants to include the whole text, while SG359 abbreviates
        1. Compare “Puer natus est nobis.” in SG359 to “Puer natus est nobis et filius datus est nobis cuius imperium super humerum eius et uocabitur nomen eius magni consilii angelus.” in EINS121 (h011.h01.1)
        2. Or: “Viderunt om[ni]s.” in SG359 to “Uiderunt omnes sines fines terra salutare dei nostri” in EINS121 (h011.h11.1).
7. Make adjustments according to suggestions from ICMS and DH – updating the URN system (using Hesbert numbers; breaking passages down by genre, not numbers), conventions for noting episema
    1. Implemented these changes & updated all existing material to match!
8. Make use of the Cantus EN121 and SG359 text data available
    1. No particular use for this yet, so we have not used it.
9. Add to and improve documentation and methodology texts
    1. For editing and validating methodologies see [here](https://toarmstrong.github.io/chants-tutorial18/); for the Chant Editor’s Quick Start Guide [here](https://github.com/HCMID/chant/wiki/Chant-Editor's-Quick-Start-Guide) 

## Further Reflection

The soft skills I have gained through this tutorial include a broader understanding of the goal and meaning of a digital edition-- and the hard skills: everything I need to know to create and validate an edition from start to finish.  This tutorial has enabled the chants project to create and improve editing standards, implement validation, and provide training for new and returning members.  It has given the chant project longevity through documentation and training, and has improved the scholarship produced by the chant team by improving our editing and validation standards.  

On a personal level, I am more seriously considering a future career in digital humanities or information science.  I have connected my work with chant to my library and museum work-- since editing is about how we create narratives and frame existing material.  I am excited to return to this work to consider the digital environment for preserving and organizing knowledge.
