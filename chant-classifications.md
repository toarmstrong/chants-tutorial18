## Definitions

*Chant* is typically organized according to feast and categorized according to genre.  
*Chant* is typically defined as one unit of music and text, fulfilling one genre, which may be re-used in various feasts but is used for at least one feast day.  
*Genre* is an analytic and directional tool applied at the time of manuscript writing and later to categorize chants based on intended performance and musical texture.  
*Feasts* according to the liturgical canon represent periods dedicated to specific subjects.  

## MID Chant

MID Chant defines a chant unit as a unit of linked text and music with rubric.  Each chant unit is catalogued and organized hierarchically into a ‘feast day’ as defined by the manuscript organization and the liturgical canon.  Likewise, feast days are catalogued and organized according to the manuscript and the liturgy.  Each unit of chant is made up of several parallel aligned sections: it must include a section of text; and it often includes a section of music (encoded in neumes) and rubric.  

Chant units are defined as unique units of text as they appear separated on the page and as logically follows based on canonical descriptions of chant text.  As there is no canonical neume pattern, sections of neumes for chant are defined as they relate to the text.  Thus, they are parallel aligned with the text.  Neume documents are created separately from text documents such that an edition could include one or both, aligned or separated.
