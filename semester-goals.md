## Goals for this semester
### Learning goals
- Gain a better understanding of the meaning and value of a multitext edition through academic research and practical application, especially as it applies to chant 
- Learn from a broad range of digital humanities (particularly musicological) projects to understand the nuance of our own
  - Create a comprehensive review of digital humanities projects working on St. Gall notation beginning with materials developed for ICMS and DH2018
  - Understand the history of editions from manuscript to facsimile to digital
- Learn XML more comprehensively (i.e. beyond the tags needed for Einsiedeln 121 so far)
### Practical goals for the Chant project:
- Improve the workflow for editing chant – what is the most accurate and efficient method for recording neumes? 
  - Develop validation system to check entered data automatically
  - Determine best practices for teaching/learning neumes, which will make it easier for new and returning students to enter data
  - Create or conceive new tools (like the neume-picker) that will make this process more efficient and accurate
- Add to our edition – complete Christmas Day and at least five more feast days for Einsiedeln 121 (by the semester’s end), with comparisons in SG359
  - Determine which feasts in particular will provide the most provocative comparisons, and complete those (semester & beyond)
- Research other manuscripts that would be appropriate to compare to EN121 and SG359 such as St Gallen 339 – for future chanters
- Make adjustments according to suggestions from ICMS and DH – updating the URN system (using Hesbert numbers; breaking passages down by genre, not numbers), conventions for noting episema
- Make use of the Cantus <a href="http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/source/123779">EN121</a> and <a href="http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/source/672485">SG359</a> text data available
- Add to and improve documentation and methodology texts 
## Extended goals
### Personal:
- To connect digital humanities and information science with Art History in new and useful ways (e.g. a digital catalogue raisonné with detailed provenance linked to museum collections and scholarly texts)
- Develop tools to make art (& art museums) more accessible – physically as well as intellectually – through translation, explanation, etc.
- Pursue a Ph.D. in art history – particularly in modern art and collecting in the interwar period in the United States
### For the Chant Team:
- To create a long-lasting team that will continue to work on the problems of editing chant and which will challenge the conventions of current chant editions 
- Understand and develop trainings (intro to chant and neumes, intro to editing) necessary to bringing new students into the chant group
- Develop a user interface with the chant data (so we can show off!)
