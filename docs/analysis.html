<h1>Ideas for analysis</h1>

<h2>Melodic patterns</h2>
<p><b>What melodic patterns are present in:</b></p>
<ul><li>individual chants (Puer Natus Est...)</li>
<li>chant genres (like introits, graduales, etc.)</li>
<li>one manuscript</li> 
  <li>comparable manuscripts (like Eins121 & SG359)</li></ul>
<p>What patterns are visible in repeated neume sequences? I.e.: does a specific string repeat itself again and again?</p>
<p>Which patterns appear if the neume itself is broken down to lows/highs/neutrals?  If we could equate, for example, a pes to a neutral-high and a virga to a neutral, could we turn edited neumes into something comparable to the Hispanic Neumes project?  If so, what other patterns emerge?</p>
<p>Are there patterns that seem to be tied to certain genres or parts of a genre or chant? Does a certain phrase only ever occur at the beginning of a graduale, for example?</p>

<h3>Relationship of melodic patterns to textual content</h3>
<ul><li>Do specific words have repeated melodies?</li>
<li>Do specific melodic phrases have repeated melodies across different genres?</li>
  <li>What is the relationship of melodic patterns and text compared between manuscripts?</li></ul>

<h2>Musical texture</h2>
<p>How can we compute musical texture? Is it more accurate to consider:</p>
<ul><li>number of neumes : number of syllables</li>
  <li>frequency of neumes (are there more 4-note neumes in a section?)</li>
  <li>number of pitches : number of syllables</li></ul>

  <p>With a computed musical texture, we could:</p>
<ul><li>consider the textures most common for each genre of chant</li>
<li>compare overall texture between manuscripts (for the whole manuscript, a feast, or a chant)</li>
<li>compare texture of chants or feasts</li>
  <li>examine the changes in texture between chants, between feasts, or within a chant</li></ul>
