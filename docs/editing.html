<h1>Editing</h1>

<h2>The Basics of Editing</h2>

<h3><b>You will need:</b></h3>
<ul><li>the edition (found in chant/editions)</li>
  <li>hesbert-sequence (for feast and chant ID numbers) found in toarmstrong/chant-tutorial18/hesbert/</li>
  <li>the surface (citable image files found in chant/surfaces)</li>
  <li>allowed XML vocabulary (found in toarmstrong/chant-tutorial18/chants-vocab.cex)</li></ul>

<p>Structure of editing:</p>

<pre><code>
<!--
<div n="FEASTID">
   <div n="CHANTID">
      <ab n="ARBITRARY NUMBER">THE TEXT/NEUMES GO HERE</ab>
   </div>
</div>
--> 
</code></pre>

<p>The feast & chant ID numbers come from Hesbert. We precede these numbers with an <code>h</code> for Hesbert.</p>

<p>The number for the <code>`<ab>`</code> begins with 1 for each new chant. When describing a rubric, use rubric.</p>

<p><b>Using Hesbert</b></p>
<p>The Feast & Chant identification numbers come from the Corpus Antiphonarium Officium, organized by Rene Jean Hesbert. The records list a three-digit feast ID number and a two-digit chant ID number. We match the text and feast to Hesbert's records, and use the feast and chant number in our URN.</p>

<p>Hesbert's records appear like:</p>

<code>001	09	Cm	Dominus dabit benignitatem	RB KS</code>

<ul><li>The first number (3 digits) is the Feast ID.</li>
  <li>The second number (2 digits) is the Chant ID.</li>
  <li>The third column describes the genre of the chant.</li>
  <li>The fourth lists the text -- compare these beginning words to our text.</li>
  <li>The fifth column lists manuscript sources.</li></ul>
  
<b>Various Editing Standards</b>

<ul><li>Rubric is always noted with the chant it refers to, and the <ab> it belongs to is named rubric.</li>
<li>When an Alleluia has 'Alleluia' and a verse without rubric to define the verse as a new chant, they belong to the same chant.</li>
<li>The title of a feast day is often encoded with h00 as the chant ID, according to Hesbert.</li>
<li>When a chant or feast does not occur in Hesbert, it is given an arbitrary number distinguished with a preceding x.</li></ul>

  
<h3>DSE</h3>
<p>'DSE' stands for Digital Scholarly Edition. It serves as a scheme for our edition, since we complete it in order of the manuscript. The DSE indexes three units: the text, the reference image, and the context.</p>

<p><b>The Text Citation</b></p>
<p>The text citation uses a CTS URN to describe the text. CTS = Canonical Text Sequence, and URN = universally recognized name. It is a way to persistently refer to the same section of text, whether it moves texts, appears separate from the rest of a text, or appears "in order."</p>

<p>Generate the text citation for chant with this template:</p>

<code>urn:cts:chant:massordinary.MANUSCRIPT.VERSION:FEAST ID.CHANT ID.SUBSECTION</code>

<p>The first part, urn:cts:chant:massordinary will be consistent in the chant manuscripts we have begun so far, since they are all books of chant for the Mass Ordinary.</p>

<ul><li>Manuscript: for our purposes, the 'exemplar' section of the URN is the manuscript. This could be eins121, sg359, or sg339 for the manuscripts we have already begun.
<li>Version: either text or neumes</li>
<li>Feast ID: comes from Hesbert (toarmstrong/chant-tutorial18/hesbert/) and describes each new feast, is preceded with h</li>
<li>Chant ID: comes from Hesbert (toarmstrong/chant-tutorial18/hesbert/) and describes each chant within the feast day, is preceded with h</li>
<li>Subsection: begins with 1 for each section within a chant, or it could be rubric for the rubric beginning each chant</li></ul>

  
<p>An example of a complete text citation: <code>urn:cts:chant:massordinary.sg359.text:h008.h00.1</code></p>

<p><b>Image Region of Interest</b></p>
<p>Generate the URN for the image region of interest (each cited section) using Cite2 (linked here: chant/surfaces).</p>

<p>Make sure to include the entire text and all associated neumes. Avoid anything that is not directly relevant to the cited text (You don't need to include the rubric when citing the chant. You don't need to include the chant when citing the rubric.)</p>

<p>Whatever text is included in the text citation (you can check with the edition to confirm!) should appear in the image citation.</p>

<p><b>Surface</b></p>
<p>The surface URN (like the text URN) has a standard format with specific variables.</p>

<code>urn:cite2:SOURCE:MANUSCRIPTpages.v1:PAGE NUMBER</code>

<ul><li>Source: The images we have used so far come from e-codices, so we cite them with ecod</li>
<li>Manuscript: The same code as appears in the Text URN: eins121, sg359, sg339 ("pages" appears here, it could also be images, but since we are citing pages, it stays!)</li>
  <li>Page Number: As according to e-codices' numbering system</li></ul>

  A complete example: urn:cite2:ecod:sg359pages.v1:36
